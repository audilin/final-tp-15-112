Batty Cave README file

Description:
- Like Flappy Bird, but with a sidescrolling terrain instead of pipes.
- In addition, the player cannot actually see the terrain. Instead, there is a circle around the player that reveals the terrain within a certain radius.
- Based off of a real game that can be played on a phone (also called Batty Cave)

The user should run "battycave.py" in order to run the program.

PIL/Pillow must be installed by the user in order for the game to work.
